## Homework

### 1. Plan for Tic Tac Toe
- Use the problem solving framework to break down all the pieces for Tic Tac Toe  

**Rules:**  
1) 3x3 game board  
2) Two players: X and O  
3) Players alternate choosing spaces  
4) Game ends when all spaces are filled or one player has 3 spaces in a row  

### 2. Implement Tic Tac Toe v1
- Use a single array as the game board  

### 3. Implement Tic Tac Toe v2
- Use a multi dimensional array as the game board  

### 4. Implement Tic Tac Toe v3
- Make the game board 5x5 instead of 3x3  
- Use loops or iterators to clean up your code  

### 5. Implement Connect 4

**Rules:**  
1) 6x6 game board  
2) Two players: X and O  
3) Players alternate choosing column to put their pieces into  
4) Pieces put in a column drop to the bottom most row  
5) Game ends when all spaces are filled, or a user has 4 pieces in a row
