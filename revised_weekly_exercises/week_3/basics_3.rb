# X) Methods: Using Arguments
#
# An argument is the value we give to a method
#
# The argument can be surrounded by optional parenthesis

# Example:
#

# puts is the method
# 'hello' is the argument
puts 'hello'


# [1, 2, 3] is the array
# include? is the method
# 4 is the argument
[1, 2, 3].include?(4)










# X) Methods: defining arguments
#
# To create an argument, we add it to the method definition.
# Arguments are used to pass information into the method.
# The argument name is like a variable that is set when the
# Method is called


# my_method is the method name
# arg_1 is a placeholder for the first argument
# arg_2 is a placeholder for the second argument

def print_arguments(arg_1, arg_2)
  puts arg_1 # We can then use the argument in the method
  puts arg_2
end

print_arguments('hello', 'goodbye') # will print hello, then goodbye


# Exercise:
#
# Write a method that takes an array and an item and checks if the item is in the array


# Answer
def array_has(array_arg, item_arg)
  array_arg.include?(item_arg)
end
# /Answer









# X) Array indexes
#
# Arrays are like lists, but use different numbering.
# The number in the array is called the "Index"
#
# List:
#   1) Milk
#   2) Bread
#   3) Eggs

# Array:
#   0) Milk
#   1) Bread
#   2) Eggs

# Milk is in index 0
# Eggs is in index 2

# Example:
#
# To get an item out of the array, we use square brackets
grocery_list_2 = [ 'milk', 'bread', 'eggs' ]

grocery_list_2[0] # => returns 'milk'
grocery_list_2[2] # => returns 'eggs'



# Exercise
# write a method that:
#  1) takes an array as argument
#  2) checks if the first item is equal to the second item

# Answer
def first_equals_second(array_arg)
  array_arg[0] == array_arg[1]
end
# /Answer







# X) Changing an array
#
#
# We can change an array by adding to it with the shovel (<<)
# OR we can change it by putting something new in a specific index

# Example:
changeable_array = [ 'hello', 'goodbye', 'no', 'yes' ]

changeable_array[2] = 'nope' # Changes 'no' (in index 2) to 'nope'
changeable_array[-1] = 'yep' # Changes 'yes' (in the last index) to 'yep'


# Exercise
#
# Using indexes, replace each word with its proper spelling
misspelled_words = [ 'tihs', 'werd', 'iz', 'mispeld' ]


# Answer
misspelled_words[0] = 'this'
misspelled_words[1] = 'word'
misspelled_words[2] = 'is'
misspelled_words[3] = 'mispeld'
# /Answer







# X) Nil: Nothing is something
#
# In programming, there is a concept of nothingness
# What is in an array you put things in it?

# Exercise
nil_array = []  # An empty array

# Using indexes, get index 3.  What's it return?

# Answer
nil_array[3] # => returns nil
# /Answer










# X) Tic Tac Toe:
#
# A tic tac toe board has 9 spaces

#   0  |  1  |  2
# -----------------
#   3  |  4  |  5
# -----------------
#   6  |  7  |  8

# We can represent this as a 9 space array
#
# Example:
#
# This board:
#
#  'X' | 'O' |
# -----------------
#      | 'X' |
# -----------------
#  'O' |     |

# We can represent as
tic_tac_toe_board = [ 'X', 'O', nil, nil, 'X', nil, 'O', nil, nil ]

# or to make it easier to read:
tic_tac_toe_board = [
  'X', 'O', nil,
  nil, 'X', nil,
  'O', nil, nil
]


# Exercise:  Checking first row for win
#
# Write a method that takes the board as an argument
# and tells us if a player has won by filling in the top row

def first_row_win?(board)
  # 1) check that the first space is not nil (Hint: !=, &&)
  # 2) check that first space is equal to second (Hint: ==, &&)
  # 3) check that first space is equal to third (Hint: ==)
end

# Test cases:
winning_board = [
  'X', 'X', 'X',
  nil, 'X', nil,
  'O', nil, nil
]

non_winning_board_1 = [
  nil, nil, nil,
  nil, 'X', nil,
  'O', nil, nil
]

non_winning_board_2 = [
  'X', 'X', 'O',
  nil, 'X', nil,
  'O', nil, nil
]


# Answer
def first_row_win?(board)
  board[0] != nil &&
    board[0] == board[1] &&
    board[0] == board[2]
end
# /Answer







# Exercise: Check for win on whole board
#
# 1) write methods and tests for all possible win cases
#
# first_row_win?, second_row_win?, third_row_win?,
# first_column_win?, second_column_win?, third_column_win?,
# diag_right_win?, diag_left_win?
#
# 2) combine all the possible win cases in a single method: board_win? (Hint: ||)

# Answer
def second_row_win?(board)
  board[3] != nil &&
    board[3] == board[4] &&
    board[3] == board[5]
end

def third_row_win?(board)

# Exercise: print the first row
#
# NOTE: we are going to build the row piece by piece, so we'll use the 'print' method
#
# 1) if first space is empty, print an empty space
#    if it has a letter, print that letter
# 2) print pipe divider (|)
# 3) repeat step 1 with second space on the board
# 4) repeat step 1 with third space on the board
# 5) add a newline (Hint: puts)

# Test
test_board = [
  'X', 'X', 'O',
  nil, 'X', nil,
  'O', nil, nil
]

def print_first_row(board)
  # your code here
end


# Answer
def print_first_row(board)
  if board[0] != nil
    print board[0]
  else
    print ' '
  end

  print '|'

  if board[1] != nil
    print board[1]
  else
    print ' '
  end

  print '|'

  if board[2] != nil
    print board[2]
  else
    print ' '

# X) Abstraction
#
# Abstraction makes something less literal
#
# Example:
#
# - When we name a person in real life, the name is an abstraction for the person.
# - When we create a variable, the variable name is an abstraction of the value.
# - When we create a method, the method name is an abstraction of all the code inside of it

# In the print row method, we repeated the following code.  The only thing that changed
# was the value we were checking.  We can abstract it to a method instead

# Code:
#
# if board[index] != nil
#   print board[index]
# else
#   print ' '
# end


# Exercise: Abstract to a method
#
# Write a method that:
# 1) takes a value as an argument
# 2) If the value is nil, print a space
# 3) If the value is not nil, print the value
# 4) rewrite the print_first_row method to use this new method


# Answer
def print_not_nil(value)
  if value != nil
    print value
  else
    print ' '
  end
end

def print_first_row(board)
  print_not_nil(board[0])
  print '|'
  print_not_nil(board[1])
  print '|'
  print_not_nil(board[2])

  puts
end
# /Answer







# Exercise:  Print the whole board
#
# 1) write the print method for each row: print_second_row, print_third_row
# 2) write a print_board method that prints each row, and a line of hyphens(-) between them

# Answer
def print_second_row(board)
  print_not_nil(board[3])
  print '|'
  print_not_nil(board[4])
  print '|'
  print_not_nil(board[5])

  puts
end

def print_third_row(board)
  print_not_nil(board[6])
  print '|'
  print_not_nil(board[7])
  print '|'
  print_not_nil(board[8])

  puts

def print_board(board)
  print_first_row(board)
  puts '-'*6
  print_second_row(board)
  puts '-'*6
  print_third_row(board)
