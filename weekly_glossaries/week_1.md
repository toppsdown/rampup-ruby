# Week 1 Glossary

## Concepts
| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recursion |  | Repeating a process with a smaller problem |
| Algorithm | | Instructions for how to accomplish something |
| Precedence | | The order that things happen in |
| Abstraction | | Making code easier to write by making it less literal |
| Object | | The Noun of our code. Any "thing" (Array, Number, Boolean)  |

## Data types
| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Number | `1` `2.2` | Same as numbers in math |
| Array | `[ 42, 'text' ]` | A list that starts at 0. Access data with indexes |
| String | `'this is some text'`, `"this is more text"` | Used to store text.  Single and double quotes |
| Boolean | `true` , `false` | How the computer represents true and false |

## Tools
| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control Flow | `puts 'equal' if 1==1` | How to teach the computer to make decisions |
| Boolean Comparison | `1 == 1` returns `true`, `'text'==2` returns `false` |	Equalities and inequalities |
| Boolean Operator | AND: `1==1 && 2==2` returns `true` OR: `1==1 || 'text'==2` returns `true` | Combines boolean comparisons |

## Tools for abstraction
| Term | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable | `my_age = 27` | saving an object by giving it a name |
| While Loop | `while _condition_` | Repeat a set of instructions until condition is false |
| Function | DEFINE: `def my_function; end;` USE: `my_function` | The Verbs of our code |
| Function Argument | DEFINE: `def my_function(argument_1, argument_2)`, USE: `my_function(1, 2)` | The objects we give to a function |
| Method | `[1,2,3].length` returns `3`  | Functions called on objects |
